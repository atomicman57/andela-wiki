        Within the fellowship and in Andela generally, we generate tons of information
        by the minute and buzz words. Keeping tabs on them becomes inevitably hard
        to keep up with especially as we scale. Likewise, we also have tons of ways
        to access information (google docs, drive, slack channels,
        andela products even social media) but no single source of truth.
        What if there is a goto place where one can go check the meaning of a
        new buzz word from the learning department? What if someone wrote a wiki
        about the first country director of Lagos and I have never met him but I am
        able to learn about him from what fellows and employees who knew him wrote
        about him while he was with Andela! What if there is just this single place
        I can go to find so much information without having to browse slack channels,
        what if i can create a wiki that has not been created about a subject I am
        knowledgeable of and every other employee in the fellowship is a contributor,
        you know just the way wikipedia actually works?
        What if, what if ...
