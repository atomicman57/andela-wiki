# Andela Wikitionary

### Problem statement:
Within the fellowship and in Andela generally, we generate tons of information by the minute and buzz words. Keeping tabs on them becomes inevitably hard to keep up with especially as we scale.

Likewise, we also have tons of ways to access information (google docs, drive, slack channels, andela products even social media) but no single source of truth.

What if there is a goto place where one can go check the meaning of a new buzz word from the learning department? What if someone wrote a wiki about the first country director of Lagos and I have never met him but I am able to learn about him from what fellows and employees who knew him wrote about him while he was with Andela! What if there is just this single place I can go to find so much information without having to browse slack channels, what if i can create a wiki that has not been created about a subject I am knowledgeable of and every other employee in the fellowship is a contributor, you know just the way wikipedia actually works?
What if, what if ...

The above mentioned questions is how the idea was born. It is meant to serve as Andela Wikipedia and Dictionary of some sort. You could find and contribute to already existing wikis to make it better and more valuable.

### Design decision
We decided to make the design very minimalistic just the way the real wikipedia looks and feels, as a matter of fact this is a wikipedia clone :-).
This is intended to be an internal product and we will be the Andela while sticking to the original wikipedia UI for consistency and user experience.


### Others
Are there things we have not mentioned? WIP
